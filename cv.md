### About me:
I am a hardworking and motivated front-end developer who has acquired extensive knowledge in this field through self-education, previous work experience in
accounting and interaction with people in the field.

I believe, that my motivation to learn, improve my life and to gain new skills will lead me on the path to becoming an experienced and in-demand Frontend Developer.

### Professional skills:
* *HTML5, CSS3, SCSS*
* *JavaScript, TypeScript*
* *React, Redux, Redux Toolkit*
* *Webpack, Next.js, Figma, npm*
* *Rest API, GraphQL*
* *Git, GitHub*

### Code example:
This is my first task in [```codewars```](https://www.codewars.com/). Function ***```multiply```*** takes two numbers as arguments, multiplies them and returns the result of the multiplication. If the arguments passed are not numbers, then the function will return ```NaN```, because Arithmetic operations in ```JavaScript``` are safe.

```javascript
function multiply(a, b) {
  return a * b;
}
```
